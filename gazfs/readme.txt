GazOS Readme
------------

Welcome to GazOS, you are reading this file from the GazFS file system.
This is a alpha release, its still no where near finished at all.
So far, I have done the following things:

Keyboard
Video
Floppy
GazFS
Timer
IDT
GDT
IO support
DMA support
8259 support

Now that I have all these implemented I am now going to work on the
Multitasking and Memory management side of things, once I have tasks working
and well, then I'll start thinking about the GUI and hard disk support.

If you need some sort of information the visit my website or e-mail me.
